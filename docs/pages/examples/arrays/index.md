Arrays are just regular items. Currently, the default theme has two ways of represent them (you can of course write your own widget for arrays).

An array of other objects will be presented as a collection where you can add more items or remove them.

An array of strings with the restriction `uniqueItems` will be presented as multiple choice list.
